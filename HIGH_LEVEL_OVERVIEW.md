## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Overview

**Console App Architecture (Ink-based CLI):**
```
/source
    agent-hub.logic.tsx       # Agent discovery and management logic
    agent-hub.ui.tsx          # Agent discovery and management UI
    agent-creator.logic.tsx   # Guided creation workflow logic
    agent-creator.ui.tsx      # Guided creation workflow UI
    agent-editor.logic.tsx    # Console editing interface logic
    agent-editor.ui.tsx       # Console editing interface UI
    ai-service.tsx            # AI model integration layer
    agent-runtime.tsx         # Agent execution engine
    storage.tsx               # Agent persistence (extends existing)
    /core
      agent-templates.ts      # Template system
      agent-validator.ts      # Agent validation logic
```

**Core Services:**
- **Agent Generator**: Handles AI-powered code generation in core/
- **Agent Runtime**: Executes and monitors agent performance in core/
- **Template Manager**: Manages reusable agent patterns in core/
- **Configuration Manager**: Extends existing config system for agents

### AI Integration Strategy

**Multi-Model Approach for Cost Optimization:**
- **Fast Model** (GPT-3.5/Claude Haiku): Real-time suggestions, validation, simple edits
- **Power Model** (GPT-4/Claude Sonnet): Complex agent generation, advanced logic
- **Local Model** (Open source): Basic template generation, offline capabilities

**Prompt Engineering Framework:**
```javascript
// Agent Generation Template
const AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = {
  system: "Generate JavaScript agent code that...",
  constraints: "Must include error handling, logging, and...",
  examples: "Here are 3 successful agents of this type...",
  validation: "Ensure code follows these patterns..."
}
```

**AI Service Integration:**
- Streaming responses for real-time user feedback
- Fallback model hierarchy for reliability
- Caching layer for common agent patterns
- Usage tracking for cost optimization

### User Experience Flow Optimization

**Agent Creation Flow (3-Step Process):**

**Step 1: Define Purpose**
- Single text area with AI-powered suggestions
- Real-time validation of feasibility
- Auto-categorization and template matching
- Example prompts for common use cases

**Step 2: Configure Behavior**
- Guided form with progressive disclosure
- Interactive constraint configuration with keyboard navigation
- Text-based preview of agent logic flow
- Performance impact indicators

**Step 3: Generate & Test**
- Instant code generation with loading states
- Sequential preview and test interface
- One-click deployment to personal workspace
- Immediate feedback collection

**Agent Editing Flow (Context-Aware Interface):**
- Natural language edit requests
- Text-based diff showing proposed changes
- Inline testing for modified behavior
- Automatic backup before changes

**Priority: CRITICAL - 60% of development resources**
- Basic agent creation workflow
- AI generation service integration
- Template system foundation
- User authentication and workspace setup

### Phase 2: Agent Management Hub (Weeks 3-6)
**Priority: HIGH - 25% of development resources**
- Agent discovery interface
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Basic editing capabilities
- Agent activation/deactivation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-8)
**Priority: MEDIUM - 15% of development resources**
- Console agent editor
- Advanced AI suggestions
- Version control system
- Collaboration features

## Technical Feasibility & Risk Mitigation

### High-Confidence Components
- **Agent Template System**: Proven patterns from existing automation tools
- **AI Integration**: Well-established APIs with predictable performance
- **User Interface**: Standard React patterns with established libraries
- **Basic Agent Runtime**: JavaScript execution environment with sandboxing

### Medium-Risk Components
